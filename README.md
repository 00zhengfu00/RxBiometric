RxBiometric
===========
RxJava and RxKotlin bindings for Biometric Prompt on Android (added in Android 9 Pie, API Level 28+)

*If your app is drawing its own fingerprint auth dialogs, you should switch to using the BiometricPrompt API as soon as possible.*

It's an official statement from [Google Android Developers Blog](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/08/introducing-android-9-pie.html). RxBiometric helps you to do that via RxJava stream!
